# Altitude Sickness in Pagosa Springs: Prevention, Symptoms & Remedies

Pagosa Springs sits at **7,126 feet above sea level**. Wolf Creek Ski Resort starts at **10,300 feet** and reaches **11,904 feet** at the summit. For visitors coming from sea level, these elevations can cause **Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)** — commonly known as altitude sickness.

The good news: most people adapt within 24-48 hours. The better news: with proper preparation, you can minimize or avoid symptoms entirely. This guide covers everything you need to know about altitude sickness in Pagosa Springs — from prevention to treatment.

## Understanding Altitude Sickness

### What Is Altitude Sickness?

Altitude sickness occurs when your body doesn't get enough oxygen from the air. At higher elevations, the air is "thinner" — there's less oxygen per breath. Your body needs time to adjust by producing more red blood cells and changing how it uses oxygen.

### Pagosa Springs Elevation Context

| Location | Elevation | Risk Level |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Sea level | 0 ft | Baseline |
| Denver | 5,280 ft | Minimal risk |
| **Pagosa Springs** | **7,126 ft** | **Low to moderate** |
| Our cabin | 7,200 ft | Low to moderate |
| Wolf Creek base | 10,300 ft | Moderate |
| Wolf Creek summit | 11,904 ft | Higher risk |

### Types of Altitude Sickness

**1. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)** — Most common
- Mild to moderate symptoms
- Usually resolves within 24-48 hours
- Affects 40%+ of visitors above 8,000 ft

**2. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)** — Serious
- Fluid in the lungs
- Requires immediate descent and medical attention
- Rare below 12,000 ft

**3. High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)** — Life-threatening
- Brain swelling
- Requires immediate descent and emergency care
- Rare below 12,000 ft

**The good news**: Serious forms (HAPE/HACE) are extremely rare at Pagosa elevations. AMS is the primary concern for most visitors.

## Recognizing Altitude Sickness Symptoms

### Mild Symptoms (Common, Usually Harmless)

- **Headache** — The most common symptom (dull, throbbing)
- **Fatigue** — Feeling unusually tired despite normal sleep
- **Dizziness** — Lightheadedness, especially when standing
- **Shortness of breath** — With mild exertion (climbing stairs)
- **Nausea** — Loss of appetite, mild queasiness
- **Sleep disturbance** — Difficulty falling or staying asleep

**When to worry**: Symptoms that worsen over time, rather than improving.

### Moderate Symptoms (Should Monitor)

- **Severe headache** — Not relieved by medication
- **Vomiting** — Persistent nausea leading to vomiting
- **Extreme fatigue** — Inability to perform normal activities
- **Difficulty breathing at rest**
- **Loss of coordination** — Trouble walking straight

**Action needed**: Rest, hydrate, consider descending if no improvement.

### Severe Symptoms (Seek Medical Help)

- **Chest tightness or congestion**
- **Coughing up frothy or pink sputum** (HAPE sign)
- **Confusion or altered mental state** (HACE sign)
- **Inability to walk straight**
- **Severe shortness of breath at rest**

**Action needed**: Immediate descent and medical attention. Call 911.

## Prevention: Before You Arrive

### Pre-Acclimatization (If Possible)

**The gold standard**: Spend a night or two at moderate elevation before coming to Pagosa.

**Good intermediate stops**:
- Denver (5,280 ft) — Minimal benefit but better than sea level
- Colorado Springs (6,035 ft) — Moderate acclimatization
- Durango (6,512 ft) — Good intermediate elevation

**Reality check**: Most visitors can't do this. That's okay — other strategies work too.

### Medication Prevention

**Acetazolamide (Diamox)**
- **Effectiveness**: Proven to speed acclimatization
- **Dosage**: 125-250mg twice daily, starting 24 hours before ascent
- **Side effects**: Tingling fingers/toes, increased urination
- **Prescription required**: Yes
- **Who should consider**: Anyone with history of AMS, or very concerned visitors

**Ibuprofen**
- **Effectiveness**: Moderate evidence for headache prevention
- **Dosage**: 600mg three times daily
- **Over-the-counter**: Yes
- **Benefit**: Also helps with altitude headache if it occurs

**Note**: Consult your doctor before taking any medication for altitude prevention.

### Other Pre-Arrival Strategies

**Hydration**:
- Start drinking extra water 2-3 days before travel
- Aim for pale yellow urine (sign of good hydration)
- Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol before/during travel

**Fitness**:
- Being in good shape helps, but doesn't prevent AMS
- Even elite athletes get altitude sickness
- Don't overexert yourself upon arrival

**Sleep**:
- Get good sleep before traveling
- Sleep deprivation worsens altitude symptoms

## Prevention: Your First 24 Hours in Pagosa

### The Golden Rules

**1. Take It Easy**
- **Day 1**: Light activities only — walking downtown, soaking in hot springs
- **Avoid**: Strenuous hiking, skiing, or heavy drinking
- **Listen to your body**: Rest when you feel tired

**2. Hydrate Aggressively**
- **Target**: Double your normal water intake
- **Minimum**: 3-4 liters per day for adults
- **Monitor urine**: Should be pale yellow, not dark
- **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid first 24 hours (dehydrates)

**3. Eat Carbohydrates**
- Carbs are easier to metabolize at altitude
- Pasta, rice, bread — comfort foods are good choices
- Avoid heavy, greasy meals first day

**4. Get Sleep**
- Altitude often disrupts sleep initially
- Don't fight it — rest when tired
- Avoid sleeping pills (can suppress breathing)

### What to Do on Arrival Day

**Ideal first day itinerary**:
1. **Arrive, settle in** — unpack, get oriented
2. **Light lunch** — something easy to digest
3. **Gentle walk** — explore downtown Pagosa Springs (relatively flat)
4. **Hydrate** — drink water consistently
5. **Hot springs soak** — helps with acclimatization (see below)
6. **Early dinner** — carb-heavy, moderate portions
7. **Early bedtime** — your body is working hard to adapt

## The Hot Springs Connection

### Do Hot Springs Help with Altitude Sickness?

**Short answer**: They don't hurt, and might help indirectly.

**Benefits**:
- **Relaxation** — reduces stress that can worsen symptoms
- **Hydration reminder** — you'll want water after soaking
- **Light activity** — walking to/from springs is gentle exercise
- **Sleep aid** — soaking before bed can improve sleep quality

**Cautions**:
- **Don't overdo it** — extended hot soaking can be dehydrating
- **Hydrate before and after** — drink water around your soak
- **Listen to your body** — if you feel dizzy, get out
- **Limit first day** — short soak (15-20 minutes) rather than marathon sessions

## Treatment: Managing Altitude Sickness

### Mild Symptoms Treatment

**If you develop mild AMS**:

**1. Stop Ascending**
- Don't go higher (like skiing Wolf Creek summit)
- Stay at current elevation or descend slightly

**2. Rest**
- Cancel strenuous activities
- Nap if needed
- Let your body work on adaptation

**3. Hydrate**
- Increase water intake
- Consider electrolyte drinks
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine

**4. Medication**
- **Ibuprofen**: 600mg for headache (every 6 hours as needed)
- **Acetazolamide**: If you have it, continue or start taking

**5. Light Carbohydrates**
- Soup, crackers, toast
- Avoid heavy or greasy foods

**Timeline**: Most mild AMS resolves within 24-48 hours with rest.

### When to Descend

**Descend if**:
- Symptoms worsen over 24 hours
- Moderate symptoms develop (vomiting, severe headache)
- You need relief to function
- Going down 1,000-2,000 feet usually provides rapid improvement

**Descent destinations from Pagosa**:
- **Durango** (6,512 ft) — 1 hour drive
- **Farmington, NM** (5,395 ft) — 1.5 hours drive
- Even **driving down to South Fork** (8,228 ft) can help

## Myths About Altitude Sickness

### Myth: "Being in good shape prevents altitude sickness"
**Reality**: Fitness helps with exertion but doesn't prevent AMS. Elite athletes get altitude sickness too.

### Myth: "Drinking alcohol helps you acclimate"
**Reality**: Alcohol dehydrates and suppresses breathing — both worsen altitude sickness.

### Myth: "Caffeine is bad at altitude"
**Reality**: Normal caffeine intake is fine. Just don't overdo it, and stay hydrated.

### Myth: "If you haven't gotten sick by day 2, you're fine"
**Reality**: AMS can develop anytime in the first 2-4 days. Stay vigilant.

### Myth: "Local remedies work better than medical treatment"
**Reality**: While coca tea helps in the Andes (different plant), there's no "local Pagosa remedy" that beats proven strategies: hydration, rest, and descent if needed.

## Real Guest Experiences

**Sarah from Florida**:
> "I was so worried about altitude sickness since we live at sea level. We followed the advice to take it easy the first day — just walked around town and soaked in the hot springs. I felt a little headache-y that evening, but woke up fine the next morning. By day 2, I was skiing Wolf Creek with no issues!"

**The Johnson Family**:
> "Our 8-year-old felt nauseous our first night. We gave her lots of water, crackers, and an early bedtime. She slept 10 hours and woke up completely fine. We just adjusted our plans — easy morning instead of early ski departure — and the rest of the trip was great."

**Mike from Texas**:
> "I got a pretty bad headache our first afternoon. Took ibuprofen, drank a ton of water, and went to bed early. Skipped the après-ski drinks that night. Woke up feeling 100% and skied hard the next three days."
