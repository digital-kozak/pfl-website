For the ultimate wilderness skating adventure, Williams Creek Reservoir offers pristine alpine scenery and the chance to skate where few others venture. At over 8,000 feet elevation, this mountain lake freezes solid and early.

### 4. **Private Ponds & Lakes**

Many ranches and private properties in the Pagosa area have ponds that freeze solid in winter. If you're staying at a vacation rental with pond access (like some properties on the [Aspen Springs](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Pagosa-Springs--CO--United-States/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes) plateau), you may have private skating available.

**Ask Your Host:**
- Is the pond safe for skating?
- Has ice thickness been checked?
- Are there any hazards (springs, inlets)?

## Ice Safety: The Most Important Section

### Understanding Ice Thickness

**Safe Ice Guidelines:**

| Activity | Minimum Ice Thickness | Recommended |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Walking/skating (one person) | 4 inches | 5+ inches |
| Group skating | 5 inches | 6+ inches |
| Hockey/rough play | 5 inches | 7+ inches |
| Snowmobiles/ATVs | 7 inches | 8+ inches |

### How to Check Ice Thickness

**The Ice Chisel Method:**
1. Bring an ice chisel or auger
2. Drill or chip a hole near shore first
3. Measure with a tape measure
4. Check multiple spots — ice thickness varies
5. Look for clear, blue ice (strongest)

**Warning Signs of Unsafe Ice:**
- ❌ Cracked or honeycombed ice
- ❌ Ice near inlets, outlets, or springs

- ❌ Ice with dark, porous appearance
- ❌ Flowing water underneath
- ❌ Ice less than 4 inches thick

### What to Do If You Fall Through

**If You Fall In:**

2. Turn toward where you fell in (ice was strong there)
3. Use ice picks or nails on a rope to grip ice
4. Kick your legs and pull yourself onto belly
5. Roll away from hole — don't stand up
6. Get to shelter and warm up immediately

**If Someone Else Falls In:**
1. **DO NOT** go onto the ice
2. Call 911 immediately
3. Extend a rope, pole, or branch
4. Throw a flotation device
5. Encourage them to stay calm and kick
6. Guide them to roll onto ice, not climb

### Ice Safety Equipment

**Recommended:**
- Ice picks (wear around neck)
- Throw rope
- Whistle
- Cell phone (in waterproof bag)

**What to Wear:**
- Layers of warm clothing
- Waterproof outer layer
- Hat and gloves
