## The "Skip It" List

Places that consistently underwhelm:

1. **Any restaurant in a hotel lobby** — Generic, overpriced
2. **Main Street places with aggressive sidewalk touts** — If they need to pull you in, the food isn't good enough
3. **"Southwestern fusion" spots without local reviews** — Real Southwestern food doesn't need to call itself fusion

## Special Categories

### Best Green Chile

Colorado takes green chile seriously. Here's where to get it:

**Gold**: Tequilas — authentic, spicy, perfect on everything  
**Silver**: Root House — breakfast burrito version is legendary  
**Bronze**: Boss Hogg's — smoked green chile is a unique twist

### Best Burger

**1. Pagosa Brewing** — Consistently excellent, great buns  
**2. Riff Raff** — Craft beer pairing elevates the experience  
**3. Boss Hogg's** — BBQ burger is a meat-lover's dream

### Best Date Night

**First date**: Riff Raff — casual, easy conversation, good fallback options  
**Established relationship**: Alley House — special occasion worthy  
**Anniversary**: The Rose (if open) — memorable, unique

### Best Family Dinner

**With kids**: Pagosa Brewing — casual, loud enough that kids won't bother anyone  
**Multi-generational**: Harman Park Grill — something for everyone  
**Picky eaters**: Mountain Pizza — build-your-own solves everything

## Seasonal Considerations

### Summer Dining

- **Best patios**: Riff Raff (riverside), Pagosa Brewing (mountain views)
- **Farmers market**: Saturday mornings for fresh ingredients to cook at your cabin
- **Food trucks**: Check the brewery lots — rotating trucks offer variety

### Winter Dining

- **Cozy spots**: Alley House, Root House (intimate tables)
- **Après-ski**: Riff Raff is the unofficial gathering spot
- **Early closures**: Some restaurants close earlier in winter — call ahead

### Shoulder Season (April-May, October-November)

- **Reduced hours**: Many restaurants limit days or hours
- **Call ahead**: Don't assume your favorite spot is open
- **Off-season specials**: Some places offer deals to attract locals

## The Bottom Line

Pagosa Springs isn't a culinary destination in the way that Aspen or Telluride might be. What it offers is something arguably better: **honest food made by people who care**, served in a town that hasn't lost its soul to tourism.

The best meals in Pagosa aren't necessarily the fanciest. They're the breakfast burrito that fuels your hike, the burger you eat on a sunny patio after skiing, the pizza you share with family in your cabin. This guide points you toward those experiences — the ones that make a trip memorable.
