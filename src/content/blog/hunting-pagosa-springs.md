# Hunting in Pagosa Springs: A Sportsman's Paradise

The San Juan Mountains surrounding Pagosa Springs offer some of Colorado's most spectacular hunting opportunities. With vast wilderness areas, abundant game populations, and breathtaking scenery, this region draws hunters from across the country seeking trophy elk, mule deer, and more.

## Why Hunt the San Juans?

Colorado's Game Management Unit (GMU) 77, which encompasses the Pagosa Springs area, consistently produces quality animals thanks to:

- **Vast public land** — San Juan National Forest and Weminuche Wilderness
- **Limited hunting pressure** — compared to Front Range units
- **Diverse terrain** — from alpine meadows to dense timber
- **Healthy herds** — excellent elk and deer populations

## Big Game Hunting Opportunities

### Elk Hunting

The San Juans are renowned for **trophy bull elk**:

| Season | Dates | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| Archery | Early September | Over-the-counter tags |
| Muzzleloader | Mid-September | Draw required |
| Rifle (1st) | October | Draw required |
| Rifle (2nd) | November | Over-the-counter tags |
| Rifle (3rd) | November | Over-the-counter tags |

**Tactics:**
- **Early season:** Glass alpine meadows at dawn/dusk
