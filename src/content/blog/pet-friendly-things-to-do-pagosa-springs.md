## Important Pet Safety Tips

### Wildlife Awareness

Pagosa is wild country — encounters with wildlife are possible:

- **Elk and Deer**: Common; keep dogs leashed to prevent chasing
- **Coyotes**: Present in the area; supervise dogs closely
- **Porcupines**: Dogs + porcupines = expensive vet bills
- **Snakes**: Rare, but rattlesnakes live here; stay on trails

### Mountain Safety

- **Altitude**: Dogs feel altitude too; take it easy the first day
- **Hydration**: Bring extra water; mountain air is dry
- **Paw Protection**: Hot pavement in summer, ice in winter
- **Weather**: Mountain storms roll in fast; have an exit plan

### Local Etiquette

- **Pick up after your dog** — always, everywhere
- **Respect leash laws** — required in town and some trails
- **Control barking** — especially at restaurants and lodges
- **Don't leave dogs in hot cars** — even for "just a minute"
