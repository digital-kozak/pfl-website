## Tips for Visiting Pagosa Springs with Kids

### Before You Arrive
✅ **Book accommodations early** — family-friendly spots fill up fast, especially during ski season

✅ **Pack layers** — mountain weather changes quickly, even in summer

✅ **Bring altitude medication** — some kids experience mild altitude sickness at 7,000+ feet

### During Your Visit
✅ **Take it slow** on day one — let kids adjust to the altitude

✅ **Bring snacks everywhere** — active kids burn lots of calories

✅ **Sunscreen is essential** — UV is stronger at high elevation

✅ **Stay hydrated** — altitude + activity = dehydration risk
