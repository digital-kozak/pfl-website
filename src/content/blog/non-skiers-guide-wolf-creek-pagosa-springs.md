## Planning a Mixed Group Trip

### Strategies for Groups with Skiers and Non-Skiers

**Option 1: Split Days**

- Afternoon: Reunite for hot springs or group dinner

**Option 2: Partial Ski Days**
- Skiers do half-day passes (available at Wolf Creek)
- Afternoon: Group activity together (snowshoeing, sledding)

**Option 3: Alternating Activities**
- Day 1: Everyone skis (non-skiers take lessons)
- Day 2: Non-skiers' choice (spas, shopping, snowshoeing)
- Day 3: Group adventure (snowcat tour, scenic drive)

### Communication is Key

**Set expectations**:
- Non-skiers shouldn't feel left out
- Skiers shouldn't feel guilty
- Plan shared experiences
- Respect different energy levels

## Gear for Non-Skiers

## Safety for Non-Skiers

- Basic first aid

## The Non-Skier's Perspective: Embracing the Experience

### Reframing "I Don't Ski"

**Instead of**: Missing out on the main attraction  
**Think of**: Experiencing the mountain differently

**The truth**: Some of the most beautiful, peaceful moments at Wolf Creek happen away from the lifts. Sunrise over the San Juans, the quiet of a snowshoe trail, the satisfaction of building a perfect snowman — these are valid mountain experiences.

### Finding Your Winter Joy

**Questions to discover your ideal non-skiing activity**:
- Do you prefer active or relaxed experiences?
- Are you seeking solitude or social time?
- Do you want to be outdoors regardless of weather?
- Are you interested in learning new skills?

**Matching activities**:
- **Active + social**: Group snowshoe tour
- **Active + solitary**: Solo snowshoe hike
- **Relaxed + social**: Hot springs with friends
- **Relaxed + solitary**: Photography, reading by fireplace

## Making It Work: Tips from Mixed Groups

**From families who've done it**:

**The Martinez Family** (Mom skis, Dad doesn't):
> "We figured out that Dad taking the kids sledding while I ski a few runs works perfectly. We meet for lunch, then afternoon hot springs together. Everyone's happy."

**The Chen Group** (3 skiers, 2 non-skiers):
> "The non-skiers book a spa day while we ski, then we all do the snowcat tour together. It's become our tradition — best of both worlds."

**The Grandparents** (watching kids while parents ski):
> "We take the grandkids to the snow play area at Wolf Creek. Easy, safe, and the kids have a blast. Parents get their ski time, we get precious time with the little ones."
