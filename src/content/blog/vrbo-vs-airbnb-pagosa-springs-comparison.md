# VRBO vs Airbnb in Pagosa Springs: Where to Book Your Mountain Getaway

When searching for a **vacation rental in Pagosa Springs**, you're likely comparing two major platforms: **VRBO** (Vacation Rentals By Owner) and **Airbnb**. While both list similar properties, the booking experience, fees, and policies can differ significantly.

As hosts who list on both platforms (and have booked through both as travelers), here's our honest comparison to help you choose the right platform for your Pagosa Springs trip.

## The Platform Overview

### VRBO (Vacation Rentals By Owner)

**History**: Launched in 1995, originally focused on owner-direct rentals  
**Owned by**: Expedia Group  
**Focus**: Entire homes — no shared rooms or private rooms  
**Strength**: Traditional vacation rental market (beach houses, mountain cabins, ski rentals)

### Airbnb

**History**: Launched in 2008, disrupted the hospitality industry  
**Owned by**: Airbnb, Inc. (public company)  
**Focus**: All types — shared rooms, private rooms, entire homes, experiences  
**Strength**: Urban areas, unique stays, younger demographic

## Inventory Comparison: Pagosa Springs

### What We Found

Both platforms list similar properties in Pagosa Springs, but there are differences:

| Feature | VRBO | Airbnb |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Total listings (Pagosa area)** | ~400 | ~500 |
| **Entire homes/cabins** | 100% | ~60% |
| **Unique/quirky stays** | Few | Many (yurts, tiny homes, etc.) |
| **Downtown condos** | Moderate | More available |
| **Luxury properties** | Well-represented | Well-represented |
| **Budget options** | Fewer | More (rooms, shared) |

### Our Property: Where to Book

**Pro tip**: Check both! Sometimes one platform has promotions the other doesn't.

## Fee Comparison: What You'll Actually Pay

**Typical for $1,500 stay**: $90-180

- ✅ **Kid-friendly filters**: Excellent for families

**VRBO Weaknesses**:

### Best Filters for Pagosa Springs

- **VRBO**: Filter by "skiing" under activities, "fireplace," "hot tub"
- **Airbnb**: Search "Wolf Creek" in description, filter by "entire home"

**For Families**:

- **Airbnb**: "Family/kid friendly" tag, but less detailed

**For Groups**:

- **Airbnb**: Group booking features, split payment options

## Booking Process Comparison

### Making a Reservation

**VRBO Process**:
1. Search and filter properties
2. Review details and calendar
3. Click "Request to Book" or "Book Now"
4. Owner has 24 hours to accept (or instant booking)
5. Payment processed upon acceptance
6. Receive confirmation and check-in details

**Airbnb Process**:
1. Search and filter properties
2. Review details and calendar
3. Click "Reserve" (instant book) or "Request to Book"
4. If instant book: immediate confirmation
5. If request: host has 24 hours to accept
6. Payment processed upon confirmation

**Key Difference**: Airbnb pushes "instant book" more aggressively; VRBO still has more owner-approval bookings.
