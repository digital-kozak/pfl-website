# Hot Springs in Pagosa Springs: Which One Should You Visit?

Pagosa Springs is built on top of the world's deepest geothermal hot spring — and locals have been soaking in its healing waters for centuries. The name "Pagosa" itself comes from the Ute word "Pagosah," meaning "healing waters." Whether you're recovering from a day of skiing at Wolf Creek, soothing muscles after a long hike, or simply seeking relaxation and wellness, Pagosa's hot springs offer something for everyone.

The geothermal waters that bubble up from deep beneath the earth's surface here are unique in their mineral content and temperature. At over 1,000 feet deep, the Mother Spring aquifer produces water rich in minerals believed to have therapeutic properties for everything from arthritis to skin conditions. Best of all, you have multiple options for experiencing these legendary waters, ranging from full-service resort experiences to primitive natural pools.

## The Private Option: Your Cabin's Hot Tub

Here's a secret many visitors don't realize: **you don't need to leave your lodging to enjoy hot water!** And in many ways, the private hot tub at our cabin offers advantages no commercial hot springs can match.

### Benefits of Your Private Cabin Hot Tub

**Privacy** — Soak without sharing space with strangers. No awkward small talk, no crowded pools, just you and your group enjoying the experience together.
