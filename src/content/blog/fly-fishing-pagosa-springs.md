# Fly Fishing in Pagosa Springs: Gold Medal Waters Guide

Pagosa Springs sits at the confluence of the San Juan River's legendary waters, making it a premier destination for anglers seeking world-class trout fishing. Whether you're a seasoned fly fisher or casting your first line, our **Pagosa Springs vacation rental** puts you minutes from some of Colorado's most celebrated fishing waters.

## The San Juan River: Gold Medal Waters

The San Juan River below Navajo Lake Dam is designated as **Gold Medal Waters** — Colorado's highest fishing classification. This means exceptional trout habitat with the potential for trophy-sized catches.

### Why It Stands Out

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Water Type | Tailwater (consistent temperature) |
| Species | Rainbow trout, brown trout, cutthroat |
| Average Size | 16-20 inches (trophies to 30+ inches) |
| Access | Public wading and drift boat access |
| Best Seasons | Year-round (excellent winter fishing) |

### Quality Waters Section

The "Quality Waters" stretch below the dam offers:
- **Catch-and-release only** — protects trophy trout
- **Artificial flies and lures** — no bait allowed
- **Large, educated trout** — challenging but rewarding
- **Professional guides available** — local expertise pays off

**Pro tip:** Hire a local guide for your first day. They know which patterns are working and where the big fish hold.
