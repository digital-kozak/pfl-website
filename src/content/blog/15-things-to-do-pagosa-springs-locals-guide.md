# 15 Things to Do in Pagosa Springs: Beyond the Hot Springs (Local's Guide)

Most visitors come to Pagosa Springs for one of three reasons: the famous hot springs, nearby Wolf Creek Ski Resort, or simply to escape into the San Juan Mountains. But once you've soaked in the mineral pools and skied the powder, what's next?

As locals who've called this area home for years, we're sharing our **favorite hidden gems and lesser-known activities** that most tourists miss. This isn't your standard guide — we're going beyond the obvious to show you the Pagosa Springs that locals love.

## 1. Hike to Fourmile Falls (The Local's Alternative to Treasure Falls)

**Treasure Falls** gets all the attention — it's right off the highway, well-marked, and beautiful. But **Fourmile Falls**? That's where locals go when they want a waterfall hike without the crowds.

**Why it's special**: A 6-mile round trip hike through aspen groves to a stunning 100-foot waterfall. In fall, the golden aspens frame the falls perfectly.

**Getting there**: From Pagosa Springs, take Fourmile Road (Forest Road 645) about 8 miles to the trailhead. A high-clearance vehicle helps but isn't strictly necessary.

**Local tip**: Go early morning for the best light on the falls and fewer people.

## 2. Explore the San Juan Historical Museum

Tucked away on 1st Street, this small museum tells the story of Pagosa Springs from its Ute origins through the railroad era and beyond. It's the kind of place you can explore in an hour but will give you context for everything else you see.

**Don't miss**: The exhibits on the railroad workers who built the town and the old photos of the hot springs before they were developed.

**Hours**: Tuesday-Saturday, 9 AM - 4 PM  
**Cost**: FREE (donations appreciated)

## 3. Take a Scenic Drive on Wolf Creek Pass (Beyond the Ski Resort)

Most people blast through Wolf Creek Pass on their way to the ski resort, missing the **scenic overlooks and hiking trails** along the way.

**Stop at**: 
- **Lobo Overlook** (12,600 ft) — panoramic views of the San Juans
- **Alberta Park** — meadows filled with wildflowers in summer
- ** Treasure Falls trailhead** — worth the short hike even if you're not skiing

**Best time**: Fall for golden aspens, or any clear day for the views.

## 4. Sample Local Brews at Riff Raff Brewing

Yes, it's on Main Street, but most visitors walk right past it. **Riff Raff Brewing** is Pagosa's original craft brewery, housed in a historic building with outdoor seating along the San Juan River.

**Try the**: 
- **Consolation Prize IPA** — their flagship, perfectly balanced
- **Esox Lucius Pale Ale** — named after the northern pike in local waters
- **Seasonal rotating taps** — always something new

**Local secret**: They have a "locals' night" with specials — ask your server when it is.

## 5. Kayak or Tube the San Juan River

The San Juan River runs right through downtown Pagosa Springs, and in summer, it becomes a **natural water park**.

**Tubing**: Several local outfitters rent tubes and provide shuttle service. The float takes about 2-3 hours and ends right downtown.

**Kayaking**: The river has Class I-II rapids perfect for beginners. Local shops offer lessons and guided trips.

**Best time**: Late June through August when water levels are optimal.

## 6. Visit Chimney Rock National Monument

Just 20 miles from Pagosa Springs, **Chimney Rock** preserves an ancient Chacoan civilization site perched dramatically on a ridge with panoramic views.

**Why go**: The Great House Pueblo aligns with the lunar standstill — an astronomical feat achieved 1,000 years ago. The guided tours are fascinating.

**Don't miss**: The view from the High Point — on clear days, you can see four states.

**Note**: Open May-October. Check their website for tour schedules.

## 7. Shop the Pagosa Farmers Market

**Saturdays, May through September**, the Farmers Market takes over downtown with local produce, crafts, and food.

**What to buy**:
- **Local honey** — the altitude creates unique flavors
- **Palisade peaches** — when in season, they're legendary
- **Handmade crafts** — jewelry, pottery, textiles from local artisans
- **Green chile** — roasted fresh on-site during harvest season

**Local tip**: Arrive early (8 AM) for the best selection, or late (11 AM) for deals.

## 8. Hike the Continental Divide Trail

The **Continental Divide Trail (CDT)** passes just west of Pagosa Springs, offering world-class hiking without the crowds of more famous trails.

**Accessible sections**:
- **Elwood Pass to Piedra River** — 8 miles, moderate
- **Tank Seven Creek** — shorter out-and-back, beautiful meadows
- **San Juan River Trail** — easier option along the river

**Why it's special**: You're literally walking the spine of the continent, with water flowing to the Pacific on one side and the Atlantic on the other.

## 9. Attend a Concert at the Pagosa Springs Center for the Arts

## 10. Stargaze at the San Juan Astronomical Observatory

Pagosa Springs sits in a **dark sky area** with minimal light pollution, making it perfect for stargazing.

**Best spots**:
- **Lobo Overlook** — high elevation, 360-degree views
- **Our cabin's hot tub** — soak under the stars (seriously, the Milky Way is visible most nights)
- **Any meadow outside town** — just pull over and look up

**Special events**: The observatory occasionally hosts public viewing nights — check their Facebook page.

## 11. Take a Fly-Fishing Lesson

The San Juan River is famous among anglers for its **gold medal trout waters**, and several local outfitters offer lessons for beginners.

**Why it's worth it**:
- Professional guides know exactly where the fish are
- Equipment provided — no need to buy gear
- Learn proper technique from the start
- Catch-and-release conservation focus

**Best time**: Spring through fall, though winter fishing is possible with a guide.

**Popular routes**:
- **Devil Mountain Trail** — 4 miles, moderate, great views
- **Trail 600** — Easier option, suitable for families
- **Endo Mesa Loop** — Challenging mountain bike ride

**Trailhead**: Off US-160, just west of the ski resort turnoff.

## 13. Dine at Alley House

- **Sit by the river** — watch the water, read a book, breathe
