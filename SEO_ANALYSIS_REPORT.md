### 3. Keyword Cannibalization Risk 🔴

#### "Things to Do with Kids" (4 posts competing)
1. **best-things-to-do-pagosa-springs-kids-2026.md** - PRIMARY (comprehensive guide)
2. **family-activities-pagosa-springs.md** - Overlaps significantly
3. **15-things-to-do-pagosa-springs-locals-guide.md** - Section on kids
4. **family-vacation-planner-pagosa-springs.md** - Some overlap

**Recommendation:** Consolidate or differentiate:
- Post #1: Keep as comprehensive "Best Things to Do with Kids" (main guide)
- Post #2: Refocus on "Family Activities for All Ages" (multi-generational)
- Post #3: Remove kids section, focus on "locals secrets"
- Post #4: Focus on logistics/planning aspect

#### Restaurant Guides (2 posts)
1. **best-restaurants-pagosa-springs-local-guide.md** - "Local picks vs tourist traps"
2. **restaurants-pagosa-springs.md** - "Complete local dining guide"

**Recommendation:** 
- Merge or differentiate by angle
- Post #1: Keep as "Local's picks" (insider angle)
- Post #2: Refocus as "Complete restaurant directory" (comprehensive list)

#### Wolf Creek Content Cluster (10+ posts)
This is actually GOOD for topic authority, but ensure clear differentiation:

| Post | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| wolf-creek-ski-resort-guide | General overview | ✅ OK |
| wolf-creek-vs-colorado-resorts | Comparison | ✅ OK |
| spring-skiing-wolf-creek | Season-specific | ✅ OK |
| wolf-creek-early-season | Early season | ✅ OK |
| wolf-creek-powder-day | Powder strategy | ✅ OK |
| wolf-creek-parking-guide | Parking logistics | ✅ OK |
| pagosa-springs-to-wolf-creek-driving-guide | Driving directions | ✅ OK |
| non-skiers-guide-wolf-creek | Non-skiers | ✅ OK |

All are well-differentiated. Good topic cluster!

7. **"Pagosa Springs Brewery Guide"** - Growing craft beer scene

### Content Refresh Needed
